# LIMS
Custom Laboratory Information Management System

Hi Everyone!

Doug here, I'm excited to kickoff my new LIMS project and tackle some of the problems that plague my day job with inefficiencies.

# Background

For those who are unfamiliar with LIMS, it stands for Laboratory Information Management System. Wiki describes it as a "software-based solution with features that support a modern laboratory's operations. Key features include—but are not limited to—workflow and data tracking support, flexible architecture, and data exchange interfaces, which fully 'support its use in regulated environments'".

I currently work as the Lab Supervisor in a Medical Device Development Lab that handles all its sample intake, tracking, data, and reporting through antiquated paper based methods. The goal is to improve these processes and increase productivity through software, all the while maintaining compliance with FDA regulations. This means before any software can be used, it must be validated... but we can get to that later. 

The plan is to tackle this bohemoth in sections, first up is the Data Manager.
